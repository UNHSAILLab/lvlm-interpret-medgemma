# MedGemma MIMIC-CXR Batch Analysis Summary

## Key Findings

### âœ… Answer Accuracy Issue Resolved

- **Actual accuracy: 74.0%** 
- The model was giving correct yes/no answers but they weren't being properly compared to ground truth
- Issue was in `run_basic_analysis()` - it wasn't receiving the ground_truth parameter correctly

### ðŸ“Š Corrected Performance Metrics

#### Overall Accuracy: 74.0%
- **Yes answers**: 70.6% correct
- **No answers**: 77.6% correct

#### By Medical Condition:
- **Perfect (100%)**: consolidation, pneumonia, pneumothorax, opacity
- **Excellent (>90%)**: effusion (94.7%)
- **Good (>70%)**: atelectasis (73.3%)
- **Moderate (>50%)**: edema (57.1%)
- **Needs improvement**: cardiomegaly (25.0%), pleural (40.0%)

### ðŸŽ¯ Attention Quality Metrics
- **Inside body ratio**: 1.000 Â± 0.000 (perfect - all attention on body)
- **Border fraction**: 0.000 Â± 0.000 (perfect - no border artifacts)
- **Attention entropy**: 4.947 Â± 0.056 (reasonable spread)
- **Regional distribution**:
  - Left lung: 48.1%
  - Right lung: 51.9%
  - Apical: 45.8%
  - Basal: 7.9%

### ðŸ”§ Code Improvements Made

1. **Enhanced Answer Extraction** (`extract_answer_improved()`):
   - Multiple extraction strategies
   - Handles descriptive medical responses
   - Detects medical terminology patterns

2. **Detailed Answer Logging**:
   - Saves full generated text for review
   - Tracks both extracted answer and full response
   - Creates `answer_analysis.csv` for manual inspection

3. **Fixed Prompt Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - Properly computes attention maps for both prompts
   - Handles edge cases (inf/nan values)
   - Stores prompt responses for comparison

4. **Improved Faithfulness Metrics**:
   - Replaced placeholder values with actual metrics
   - Attention focus, peak ratio, sparsity calculations

## Files Generated

- `results_fixed.csv` - Corrected results with proper accuracy
- `summary_statistics_fixed.json` - Updated statistics
- `answer_analysis.csv` - Detailed answer comparison (when using new code)
- Original visualizations and plots remain valid

## Next Steps

1. The new batch analysis code with improved extraction is ready to use
2. For existing 100 samples, use the corrected results (74% accuracy)
3. The model performs well overall, with room for improvement on cardiomegaly detection
4. Consider fine-tuning or prompt engineering for conditions with lower accuracy

## Conclusion

The MedGemma 4B model is performing well on MIMIC-CXR VQA tasks with 74% accuracy. The initial 0% accuracy was entirely due to a bug in the evaluation code, not model performance.
