# Update: Comprehensive Attention Analysis Expansion

## Expanded Analysis Scope

We are expanding our attention analysis from the initial **14 comparisons** (10 cases with changed answers) to a **comprehensive analysis of ALL phrasing variations**, including:

### Analysis Categories:
1. **yes→no**: Cases where baseline answers "yes" but variant answers "no"
2. **no→yes**: Cases where baseline answers "no" but variant answers "yes"  
3. **yes→yes**: Both baseline and variant answer "yes" (no change)
4. **no→no**: Both baseline and variant answer "no" (no change)

### Expanded Dataset:
- **30 question groups** (for computational feasibility)
- **~285 variant comparisons** (vs. original 14)
- Covers ALL variants, not just those that change answers

### Key Research Questions:
1. Do attention patterns differ significantly between answer-changing and non-changing cases?
2. Is there a measurable attention threshold that triggers answer changes?
3. Are certain types of answer changes (yes→no vs no→yes) associated with distinct attention patterns?
4. How consistent are attention patterns when answers remain the same despite phrasing changes?

### Expected Insights:
- **Baseline attention variability**: Understanding normal variation when answers don't change
- **Change thresholds**: Identifying if there's a consistent JS divergence threshold for answer flips
- **Direction-specific patterns**: Whether yes→no changes differ from no→yes changes
- **Robustness assessment**: Quantifying attention stability across linguistic variations

### Methodology Improvements:
1. **Stratified analysis** by change type
2. **Visualization saving** for all answer-changing cases
3. **Comprehensive statistical comparisons** between change types
4. **Correlation analysis** between attention metrics and answer changes

### Preliminary Observations:
From our initial 14-case analysis:
- Answer changes occur with **JS divergence ~0.118**
- Attention patterns maintain **93.2% correlation** even when answers change
- Both correct→wrong and wrong→correct changes show similar attention shifts

### Expected Outcomes:
This comprehensive analysis will provide:
1. **Statistical power** to determine if attention changes are significant
2. **Control group** (no-change cases) for comparison
3. **Robust conclusions** about the relationship between attention and decisions
4. **Clinical implications** for model reliability assessment

## Technical Implementation:

```python
# Comprehensive analysis structure
results = {
    'all_comparisons': [],      # All variant comparisons
    'yes_to_no': [],            # Answer flip cases
    'no_to_yes': [],            # Answer flip cases  
    'yes_to_yes': [],           # No change controls
    'no_to_no': [],             # No change controls
    'summary_statistics': {}    # Aggregated metrics
}
```

## Analysis Status:
- Currently processing 30 question groups
- Extracting attention for baseline and all variants
- Computing divergence metrics for each comparison
- Saving visualizations for answer-changing cases

This expanded analysis will provide the statistical rigor needed to draw strong conclusions about the relationship between linguistic phrasing, visual attention patterns, and model decisions in medical VQA tasks.
